# UI-DOM-API-Project

This project is meant to challenge me as a General Assembly SEI student to combine programming skills in JavaScript in addition to skills building out user interfaces with HTML and CSS.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Layout
- Programming with JavaScript
- Working with the DOM

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).
1. Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements below.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## UI Pattern

You will need to pick a UI pattern from the list below and an API. You'll then
build out the UI pattern you chose to work with the API you chose.

### UI Pattern



#### Hamburger Menu

There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on
it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the screen with a list of
menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the contents in the center of
the page should change to show the details for that item. The user should be
able to see which item is currently selected. The user should be able to close
the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.

#### Accordion

The user should see a list of items. When they click on one, the space below the
item expands to reveal the content related to that item. When the user clicks on
the item again, the revealed content becomes hidden.

#### Tabs

The user sees a row of tabs above a content area. When the user clicks on one of
the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which tab the user
clicked.

#### Slider

The user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and 'Previous'
buttons. When they click on the 'Next' button, the slider should shift to show
the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the 'Previous' button, the
slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next
or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent
the user from clicking those buttons.

## Requirements

Selected the FOODISH API and used the given base URL for all endpoints: https://foodish-api.herokuapp.com/

Each student should pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two. The
data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads
the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the
screen.

### Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Runs without errors
- Shows the UI pattern you selected populated with data from the API you
  selected
- Functions according to the descriptions above. The user should be able to
  interact with your UI.
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (_hint: look up a README
  template_)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of
  small commits.
