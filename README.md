# UI-DOM-API-Project

This project is meant to challenge me as a General Assembly SEI student to combine programming skills in JavaScript in addition to skills building out user interfaces with HTML and CSS.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Layout
- Programming with JavaScript
- Working with the DOM

## Requirements

Pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two. The
data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads
the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the
screen.

#### Hamburger Menu (This was my UI Pattern selection)

There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on
it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the screen with a list of
menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the contents in the center of
the page should change to show the details for that item. The user should be
able to see which item is currently selected. The user should be able to close
the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.
